# 📈 Direct Marketing Campaign Analysis – Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive data analysis task aimed at uncovering actionable insights from a **direct marketing campaign** conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The campaign involved outreach via phone calls to promote term deposit subscriptions.

I applied my Excel data analysis skills to clean, explore, and visualize the data, ultimately building an **interactive Excel dashboard** for stakeholder use.
